### Web Development Study Plan: 100% Practical Learning

#### Day 1: Basics of Arrays and Loops
- **Arrays in JavaScript:**
  - Create arrays and understand how to access elements.
  - Practice adding and removing elements using `push`, `pop`, `shift`, `unshift`.
  - Use methods like `concat`, `slice`, `splice`.
- **Loops with Arrays:**
  - Practice loops: `for`, `while`, `forEach`.
  - Work on scenarios like summing array elements or finding the largest number.

#### Day 2: Advanced Array Functions and Math Functions
- **Array Functions:**
  - Practice `map`, `filter`, `find`, `reduce`, `sort`.
  - Create small billing applications using these functions (e.g., calculating totals, filtering orders).
- **Math Functions:**
  - Use functions like `Math.round`, `Math.ceil`, `Math.floor`, `Math.random`.
  - Apply them in real-world scenarios like generating random invoice numbers or rounding totals.

#### Day 3: Basic String Manipulations
- **String Functions:**
  - Practice `search`, `substr`, `trim`, `length`, `charAt`, `replace`.
  - Develop small applications like extracting customer initials, trimming inputs, or searching substrings.

#### Day 4: JSON Basics and AJAX
- **JSON Basics:**
  - Learn to parse JSON strings and convert objects to JSON.
  - Handle JSON data in sample scenarios like fetching product details or storing form data.
- **AJAX and Fetch:**
  - Perform CRUD operations using `$.ajax` and the Fetch API.
  - Use real APIs to send GET and POST requests, and display results dynamically.

#### Day 5: jQuery and DOM Manipulation
- **jQuery Basics:**
  - Practice selecting elements, adding/removing classes, and modifying attributes.
  - Build interactive forms where data from one input is used to update another.
- **Custom Data Tables:**
  - Create custom tables using DataTables and Tabulator libraries.
  - Work on filtering, sorting, and paginating data dynamically.

#### Day 6: SQL Queries
- **Basic SQL Queries:**
  - Practice `SELECT * FROM table`, `CASE`, `GROUP_CONCAT`, and all types of joins.
  - Develop a small database and query data for real-world scenarios like generating reports.
- **Aggregate Functions:**
  - Work with `SUM`, `AVG`, `IS NULL`, `%` (modulus).
  - Handle decimal values in billing-related problems.

#### Day 7: Practical jQuery with SQL
- **Advanced jQuery:**
  - Fetch data from inputs and dynamically update content.
  - Create interactive forms to demonstrate data binding and validation.
- **SQL Integration:**
  - Connect frontend jQuery functionality with backend SQL queries (optional Laravel for execution).
  - Practice querying and updating data dynamically via AJAX.

#### Day -10: Project
- **Build a Mini Project:**
  - Create a billing system that uses all covered topics.
    - Features: Add products, calculate totals, apply discounts, and store data in a database.
  - Use jQuery, AJAX, SQL, and JavaScript array and string methods.
  - Present a working prototype for review.

#### Tools and Resources
- **Libraries and Tools:**
  - Practice with jQuery, DataTables, Tabulator.
  - Use tools like Postman for testing APIs and MySQL Workbench for database queries.
- **Learning Aids:**
  - Online resources like W3Schools, MDN Web Docs, and library documentation for troubleshooting.
